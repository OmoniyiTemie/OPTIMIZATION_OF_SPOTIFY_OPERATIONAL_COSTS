# PROJECT 1: OPTIMIZATION OF SPOTIFY OPERATIONAL COSTS


## DATASET - [Spotify Revenue, Expenses and Its Premium Users â€“ Quarterly Report (Q4 2016 - Q1 2023)](https://github.com/OmoniyiTemie/OPTIMIZATION_OF_SPOTIFY_OPERATIONAL_COSTS/blob/main/DATASET/Spotify%20Quarterly.csv)
  *Source - Kaggle*

  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Carried out the project based on 3 research questions:

**MAIN QUESTION**

How do Spotify's operational costs impact profitability across areas?

**EFFICIENCY FOCUS**

Is Spotify effectively allocating resources to maximize profitability?

**IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES**

What actions can Spotify take to optimize costs and enhance efficiency?

**OPTIMIZATION USING THE MARGINAL COST AND THE MARGNIAL REVENUE**

*Checking how Spotify's Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost has been distributed across the quarters and the points of possible optimization (intersection where MR=MC)*
